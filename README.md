working on 2nd test for reducer.  need to look at what squares should be returning when it works correctly

check if adding parens will help with our issue

maybe use map() to map the current state to the new state with the correct square[i]

try splitting up your props to have 3 different reducers "TURN" "SWITCH_PLAYER" and "COUTNTER_PLUS"
